  "Character-spec persistence (ADR-2607071610), in two honest layers:

   1. `SpecStore` protocol + `MemSpecStore` — the swappable-backend contract,
      same shape as babiniku.governor's Store and gftd-talent-actor's
      talent.store (MemStore ≡ DatomicStore under one contract). MemSpecStore
      is what exists and is tested TODAY.

   2. `spec->tx` / `entity->spec` — the pure datom mapping a future
      kotobase-backed SpecStore transacts through. Production persistence is
      kotobase/datomic via the `:db-api` map (`{:q :transact! :db :pull
      :entid}`, langchain.db / langchain.kotoba-db's `kotoba-api` — per
      CLAUDE.md's Actors doctrine, backends are spoken to ONLY through that
      map, never directly). The kotobase-backed record itself is a follow-up,
      NOT built here — but the mapping it will transact is pure, so it's
      written and tested now, and the follow-up is wiring, not design.

   Datom shape (document-as-datom, the canvas-ledger precedent): one entity
   per character spec —
     {:kisekae/id       <spec's :spec/id, unique identity>
      :kisekae/name     <display name, for listing without parsing EDN>
      :kisekae/spec-edn <the whole spec, pr-str'd canonical EDN>}
   The spec is small; storing it whole keeps every field queryable-after-read
   without a schema migration per new spec key. If per-field datalog querying
   is ever needed, that's a schema evolution decided then, not speculatively
   normalized now.
